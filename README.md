[BioC XML / JSON format](http://bioc.sourceforge.net/) can be used to
share text documents and annotations.

[Brat standoff format](https://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html) is created by the brat annotation tool to store
annotations on disk in a standoff format. annotations are stored separately from the annotated document text, which is
never modified by the tool.

[PubTator format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) is created by the PutTator Central system.

`bioc` exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library
`marshal` and `pickle` modules.

Development of `bioc` happens on GitHub:
<https://github.com/bionlplab/bioc>

## Getting started

Installing `bioc`

```shell
$ pip install bioc
```

### BioC

Encoding the BioC collection object `collection`:

```python
from bioc import biocxml
# Serialize ``collection`` as a BioC formatted stream to ``fp``.
with open(filename, 'w') as fp
    biocxml.dump(collection, fp)
```

Decoding the BioC XML file:

```python
from bioc import biocxml
# Deserialize ``fp`` to a BioC collection object.
with open(filename, 'r') as fp:
    collection = biocxml.load(fp)
```

### Brat

Encoding the Brat document

```python
from bioc import brat
# Serialize ``doc`` as a brat formatted stream to ``text_fp`` and ``ann_fp``.
with open(annpath, 'w') as ann_fp, open(txtpath, 'w') as text_fp:
    brat.dump(doc, text_fp, ann_fp)
```

Decoding the Brat document:

```python
from bioc import brat
# Deserialize two streams (text and ann) to a Brat document object.
with open(annpath) as ann_fp, open(txtpath) as text_fp:
    doc = brat.load(text_fp, ann_fp)
```

### PubTator

Encoding the PubTator document object `doc`:

```python
from bioc import pubtator
# Serialize ``collection`` as a BioC formatted stream to ``fp``.
with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
    pubtator.dump([doc], fp)
```

Decoding the PubTator file

```python
from bioc import pubtator
# Deserialize ``fp`` to a PubTator object.
with open(filename, 'r') as fp:
    docs = pubtator.load(fp)
```
